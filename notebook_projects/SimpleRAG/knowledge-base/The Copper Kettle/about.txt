The Copper Kettle is a charming gastropub nestled in the heart of the city's burgeoning arts district. Housed in a former turn-of-the-century foundry, the restaurant's interior beautifully blends its industrial past with a cozy, contemporary feel. The high ceilings, exposed ductwork, and original riveted beams are softened by warm, amber lighting, reclaimed wood tables, and plush leather booths. A large, communal table sits at the center, encouraging conversation and a sense of community. The Copper Kettle is known for its relaxed, friendly atmosphere, making it a perfect spot for everything from a casual lunch with friends to a lively evening out. It's a place where the history of the building and the vibrancy of the food create a unique and memorable dining experience that feels both new and timeless. The restaurant also features a small outdoor patio, perfect for enjoying a drink and a bite on a warm evening.
