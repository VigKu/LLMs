The menu at The Copper Kettle is a celebration of elevated pub fare with a focus on bold, comforting flavors. The dishes are crafted using a mix of classic techniques and modern culinary creativity. For starters, the Smoked Gouda & Ale Dip served with pretzel bites is a fan favorite, as are the Crispy Brussels Sprouts tossed in a honey-balsamic glaze. Main courses offer a satisfying selection, including the signature Foundry Burger, a juicy patty topped with caramelized onions, bacon jam, and sharp cheddar on a toasted brioche bun. Another standout is the Braised Short Rib, slow-cooked to perfection and served over creamy polenta with a rich red wine reduction. For those seeking lighter options, the Harvest Salad with roasted root vegetables, candied pecans, and a maple vinaigrette provides a fresh and flavorful alternative. The dessert menu is small but impactful, with the Cast Iron Skillet Cookie, a warm chocolate chip cookie served with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream, being a must-try. The beverage program is equally impressive, featuring a rotating selection of local craft beers on tap, a creative cocktail list, and a well-curated wine selection.
