The menu at The Golden Spoon is a delightful journey through familiar flavors presented in surprising ways. Starters include the Truffle Mac & Cheese Bites, crispy on the outside with a creamy, rich interior, and the Heirloom Tomato Salad with a light basil vinaigrette and fresh burrata. For main courses, popular choices are the Smoked Brisket Sandwich served on a homemade brioche bun and the Pan-Seared Halibut with a lemon-dill sauce and roasted asparagus. Desserts are a highlight, with the Decadent Chocolate Lava Cake and the seasonal Berry Crumble being fan favorites. The drink menu features a curated selection of local craft beers and a small but excellent wine list.
