The menu at Spice Symphony is a carefully curated journey through the diverse regions of India, showcasing both well-known favorites and lesser-known regional specialties. Appetizers include the Samosa Chaat, a deconstructed version of the classic samosa with a medley of chutneys and yogurt, and the Tandoori Prawns, marinated in a spicy yogurt mixture and cooked to perfection in the clay oven. The main courses are where the culinary magic truly happens. Signature dishes include the rich and creamy Butter Chicken, the slow-cooked and deeply flavorful Lamb Rogan Josh, and the fiery Vindaloo, a testament to the cuisine of Goa. For vegetarians, the menu offers a wide array of options, such as the fragrant Paneer Tikka Masala and the hearty Dal Makhani, a lentil dish simmered for hours. The bread selection is extensive, featuring freshly made naan varieties like the garlic naan and the unique Peshawari naan stuffed with nuts and raisins. To complement the meal, the restaurant offers a selection of handcrafted cocktails, including a tamarind-infused margarita, as well as a range of lassi and other traditional Indian beverages.
